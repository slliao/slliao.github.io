Iâ€™m a Postdoc in Chemical Engineering, Stanford University. I work on a variety of projects related to lithium metal bettery, in particular the high-concentration eletrolyte. Before joining Stanford, I worked in GGA Corp. Taiwan. 

My academic traning was computational physics and I worked on time-dependent functional theory and quantum optimal control theory for several years.

This website contains my personal notes for researches and some random thoughts.
