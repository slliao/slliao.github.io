Iâ€™m a Postdoc in the Department of Chemical Engineering, Stanford University. I work on a variety of projects related to lithium metal battery, in particular the high-concentration electrolyte. Before joining Stanford, I worked in GGA Corp. Taiwan.

My academic training was computational physics and I worked on time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) and quantum optimal control theory for several years.

This website contains my personal notes for researches and some random thoughts.
