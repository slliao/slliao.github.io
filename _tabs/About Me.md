I am a Staff Scientist at Factorial Energy, where I apply advanced simulation techniques and physical chemistry principles to improve electrolytes for lithium metal batteries.

Prior to joining Factorial Energy, I pursued a postdoctoral fellowship in the Department of Chemical Engineering at Stanford University (2021-2023). There, I engaged in several projects focused on lithium metal batteries, particularly on high-concentration electrolytes. Before my journey to Stanford, I worked at GGA Corp. in Taiwan (2018-2021).

I hold a PhD in Physics, with my academic foundation in computational physics, specifically focusing on time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) and quantum optimal control theory.

This website serves as a repository for my personal research notes, reflections on random thoughts, and stories of scientists.
