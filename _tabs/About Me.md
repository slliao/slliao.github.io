I am a Senior Simulation Engineer at Factorial Energy, where I apply advanced simulation techniques and physical chemistry principles to improve electrolytes for lithium metal batteries.

Prior to joining Factorial Energy, I pursued a postdoctoral fellowship in the Department of Chemical Engineering at Stanford University. There, I engaged in several projects focused on lithium metal batteries, particularly on high-concentration electrolytes. Before my journey to Stanford, I worked at GGA Corp. in Taiwan.

My academic foundation is in computational physics, with a specific focus on time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) and quantum optimal control theory.

This website serves as a repository for my personal research notes, reflections on random thoughts, and stories of scientists.
