I’m a computational physicsist at Stanford University. I work on a variety of projects related to lithium metal bettery, in particular the high-concentration eletrolyte.Before joining Chemical Engineering, Stanford, I worked in GGA Corp. in Taiwan. 

My academic traning was computational physics and I worked on time-dependent functional theory and quantum optimal control theory for several years.
