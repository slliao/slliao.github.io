I am a Staff Scientist at Factorial Energy, where I work at the intersection of computational chemistry, non-equilibrium thermodynamics, and machine learning to understand and improve electrolytes for next-generation batteries.

My research centers on **thermodynamic properties of electrolytes** and the **electrode-electrolyte interface** — how ions are solvated, how they move, and how the interface forms and evolves. I am particularly drawn to non-equilibrium transport phenomena: understanding ionic conductivity through the lens of Onsager theory, correlated ion motion in concentrated electrolytes, and the physical origins of electrochemical performance.

In recent years I have also been developing electrochemistry-driven data science methods — combining signal analysis with machine learning to predict cycle life and support quality control for solid-state batteries.

My background is in computational physics (TDDFT and quantum optimal control theory, Ph.D. National Taiwan University). I did my postdoc in Chemical Engineering at Stanford University (2021–2023), which is where I made the jump from electrons to ions. The physics turned out to transfer surprisingly well.

My work has appeared in *Nature Energy*, *Nature Communications*, *Physical Review Letters*, and *Chemical Science*. Full list on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Qx1TdSUAAAAJ).

This website collects my research notes, simulation workflows, and thoughts on scientific computing.
