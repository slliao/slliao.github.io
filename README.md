# Mark Liao's Personal Website

**Live site:** [slliao.github.io](https://slliao.github.io)

Hi! I'm Mark, a Staff Scientist at Factorial Energy working on electrolyte design for lithium metal batteries. My background is in computational physics — specifically time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) and quantum optimal control. Before Factorial, I was a postdoc in Chemical Engineering at Stanford (2021–2023), and before that, I worked at GGA Corp. in Taiwan.

This site is where I collect my research notes, technical how-tos, and random thoughts. Think of it as a living notebook, not a polished blog.
