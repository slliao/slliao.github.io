## Gromacs

### File formats

#### tpr file
tpr file extension stands for portable binary run input file. This file contains the starting structure of your simulation, the molecular topology and **all the simulation parameters**. This file is in **binary format** it cannot be read with a normal editor. To read a portable binary run input file type:

```console
% gmx dump -s topol.tpr | less
```

You can also compare two tpr files using:
```console
% gmx check -s1 top1 -s2 top2 | more
```
#### trr file
Files with the trr file extension contain the trajectory of a simulation. In this file all the coordinates, velocities, forces and energies are printed as you told GROMACS in your mdp file. This file is in portable binary format an can be read with gmx dump.
```console
% gmx dump -f traj.trr | less
```
You can also get a quick look in the contents of the file (number of frames etc.) using:
```console
% gmx check -f traj.trr
```

### Analysis
#### [Radial distribution functions](https://manual.gromacs.org/current/reference-manual/analysis/radial-distribution-function.html#fig-rdfex)

-cn option for gmx rdf could produce the cumulative number RDF, i.e. the average number of particles within a distance r.
