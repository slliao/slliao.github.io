# SPACK

## Compiler
```
spack find -p gcc
-- linux-ubuntu22.04-x86_64_v3 / gcc@11.4.0 ---------------------
gcc@12.3.0  /home/spack/spack/opt/spack/linux-ubuntu22.04-x86_64_v3/gcc-11.4.0/gcc-12.3.0-chmemdiqoycjlxz2myvdxqzt5don54uw
==> 1 installed package
```
We can add GCC to Spack as an available compiler using the spack compiler add command. This will allow future packages to build with gcc@12.3.0. To avoid having to copy and paste GCCâ€™s path, we can use spack location -i to get the installation prefix.
```
spack compiler add "$(spack location -i gcc@12)"
==> Added 1 new compiler to /home/spack/.spack/linux/compilers.yaml
    gcc@12.3.0
==> Compilers are defined in the following files:
    /home/spack/.spack/linux/compilers.yaml
```
