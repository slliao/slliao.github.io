# Git


## Create a Branch
List all your branches:
```
$ git branch -a
```
Create a New Branch
```
git checkout -b new-branch-name
```
Or, checkout the branch you want to use:
```
$ git checkout <feature_branch> 
```

Confirm you are now working on that branch:
```
$ git branch 
```
If your local branch already exists on the remote, run this command:
```
git push
```
If your local branch does not exist on the remote, run either of these commands:
```
git push -u origin my-branch-name
```

## Merge a Branch
Check working tree is clean and see what branch you're on
```
git status
```
Check out the branch that you want to merge another branch into (changes will be merged into this branch, for example master).
```
git checkout master
```
Merge another branch into the current branch:
```
git merge my-branch-name
```

## Delete branch
```
git branch -d <feature_branch_name>
```

## Remove all previous commits

Checkout
```
git checkout --orphan latest_branch
```
Add all the files
```
git add -A
```
Commit the changes

```
git commit -am "commit message"
```
Delete the branch
```
git branch -D main
```
Rename the current branch to main
```
git branch -m main
```
Finally, force update your repository
```
git push -f GitHub main
```
